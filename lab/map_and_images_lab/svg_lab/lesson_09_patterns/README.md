# Lesson 9: Patterns

*   Tiles
*   Pattern Units
*   Pattern Content Units
*   Nested Patterns

These lessons are from the __SVG Essentials, 2nd Edition__ book.
There is another book that is entirely about gradients and patterns in SVG,
called __SVG Colors, Patterns & Gradients__ which is very good but considerably
more oriented towards expert users.
