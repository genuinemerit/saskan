# Lesson 11: Pattern and Gradient Transforms
*   Transforms as applied to Patterns and Gradients

These lessons are from the __SVG Essentials, 2nd Edition__ book.
There is another book that is entirely about gradients and patterns in SVG,
called __SVG Colors, Patterns & Gradients__ which is very good but considerably
more oriented towards expert users.
