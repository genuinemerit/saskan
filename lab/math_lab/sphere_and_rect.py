"""
Compute the dimensions of a rectangle enclosig a sphere.
Visualize the result.

This code generated by ChatGPT. It is not exactly right,
but demonstrates some good things. Play around with it as
a starting point.

Would be great to be able to:
- model ellipsoids
- model spirals
- draw rectangles (clearly) around spheres, etc.
- demonstrate collision points.
