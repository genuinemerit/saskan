When dealing with complex 3D objects that are not regular rectangles, collision detection becomes more challenging. One common approach is to approximate these objects with bounding volumes or bounding shapes, such as bounding spheres, bounding boxes, or other simpler geometry. These approximations can simplify collision detection by reducing the problem to a collision between simpler shapes.

Here's a general approach to collision detection for complex 3D objects:

1. **Bounding Volumes**: Approximate complex objects A and B with bounding volumes or shapes. Common choices include:

   - **Bounding Boxes (AABBs)**: A rectangular box that encloses the object.
   - **Bounding Spheres**: A sphere that encloses the object.
   - **Bounding Cylinders**: A cylindrical shape that encloses the object.
   - **Bounding Capsules**: A combination of spheres and cylinders.
   - **Convex Hulls**: A 3D shape that encloses the object, minimizing volume.

2. **Collision Detection**: Check for collisions between the bounding volumes. If the bounding volumes don't intersect, there's no collision. If they do, proceed with detailed collision detection.

3. **Detailed Collision Detection**: For more precise collision detection, you can use algorithms like the Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR), Separating Axis Theorem (SAT), or other 3D collision detection techniques. These methods handle complex shapes by comparing the objects' geometry and can identify contact points, normals, and penetration depth.

4. **Physics Engine**: For more complex simulations and interactions, consider using a physics engine like Pygame, PyBullet, or even a 3D physics engine like Bullet3D. These engines can handle complex collision detection, response, and dynamics simulations.

5. **Mesh Collision**: If you're dealing with 3D models represented by meshes, you can use libraries like PyMesh or specialized 3D modeling software to perform accurate mesh-to-mesh collision detection.

The choice of bounding volume or method depends on the specific shape of your objects and the computational resources available. The goal is to strike a balance between accuracy and performance. For many games and simulations, a combination of bounding boxes, bounding spheres, or convex hulls for collision detection can work well.

Keep in mind that handling collisions with complex, curved surfaces can be computationally expensive, so optimization and the choice of algorithms play a crucial role in achieving real-time performance.
