# Too many unresolved dependencides with python 3.11.0
# as of December, 2022.

# There may be a better alternative to tornado, but
# I like it even though it is kind of old-school now.

# Be sure redis is installed at the OS level before
# running this script to install python redis modules.
# May still need to install redis using pip.

# pygame is not available in the conda-forge channel
#  Have to install it using pip.
# And it has dependencies like the following which
#  may also need to be installed:
# sudo apt-get install \
#  python3-dev \
#  python3-numpy \
#  subversion \
#  ffmpeg \
#  libsdl1.2-dev \
#  libsdl-image1.2-dev \
#  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \
#  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev \
#  libavcodec-dev \
#  libavformat-dev \
#  libportmidi-dev \
#  libsmpeg-dev \
#  libswscale-dev \

# May need to install odfpy using pip.
