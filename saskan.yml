# Use Mamba to construct development virtual environment for saskan project.
# Mamba is a fast, scalable package manager for Python that is built on top of conda.

# If using Rye, it may not be necessary to build my own virtual environment.

# Using make commands to configure, build, install, distribute the project.
# The Makefile is still under development, not fully tested.
# Still investigating setuptools vs. build vs. rye vs. poetry; hatchling, uv, pipx, etc.

# MAMBA COMMANDS
# ============================
# mamba env list
# mamba env remove -n saskan
# mamba env create -f ./saskan.yml
# mamba activate saskan
# mamba deactivate
# mamba update -n base -c defaults mamba
# mamba update --all
# mamba list <package>

# OTHER REQUIRED INSTALLS
# ====================================================
# Libraries not available in the conda-forge channel or not recommended to use:

# mamba activate saskan, then... pip install --upgrade pygame

# For some reason pygame does not seem to be in conda defaults.
# If latest pygame is in conda-forge then should be able to use mamba to install pygame.
# But to ensure latest pygame is being used, get it from PyPI.
# At this point, seems like mamba has 2.5.2, the latest version.

# Also note: there are some "gui" package add-ons for pygame, but they
# are small, individual projects separate from the pygame project.
# Evaluate them before using them.

# Required at OS level to use netstat to monitor services traffic:
# sudo apt-get -y install --upgrade net-tools
# Not sure of Windows alternative. Better to find a python-only solution.

# sqlite3 is part of the standard package both in Ubutu and python3.
# No need for install unlesit s not available in the system.
# For sqlite command line commands, see:
#   https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-commands/
