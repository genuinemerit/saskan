Installation

Stable release
--------------

There is no stable release yet.

Eventually, you can install the latest stable release of Saskantinon and Saskantinize with pip:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install saskantinon

This will be the preferred method to install the game and its admin tools, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The source for Saskantinon can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/genuinemerit/saskan-app

    At present, builds to the main branch are not stable. Please use the develop branch.
    They are not stable either, but they are more up-to-date than the main branch.

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/genuinemerit/saskan-app/tarball/develop

    or

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/genuinemerit/saskan-app/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install
