<p>Saskan Eyes is an event-driven, message-based application for controlling, monitoring and editing services and content for the game "Saskantinon, The Land Between Two Rivers". 
    
<p>It uses PyQt5 (pyside2) as a GUI engine, with diagrams generated by networkx and matplotlib, then displayed as PNG images.

<p>The backend database supporting service definition, execution and monitoring is Redis.

<p>The ontology for the application is managed as an OWL structure edited using the Protege editor.  The ontology is the basis for auto-generating a relational database schema, presently implemented using SQLite, but likely to be moved eventually to Postgres or to MariaDB.

<p>Almost all programming is done in Python3.9.  There are bash shell scripts for initiating services, but hopefully these will be replaced by Python classes.

<p>Code is versioned on GitHub.

<p>So far, all testing and development is taking place on Ubuntu Linux.
