    For the purposes of the game, we consider mass and matter to
    be the same thing. Antimatter equals matter at the big bang, but
    then almost entirely vanishes. No one know why. Theoretically,
    the universe should not exist since matter and antimatter should
    have annihilated each other. But it does. So, we will assume that
    the universe is made of matter, not antimatter, and that the
    antimatter "went somewhere".
    
    For game purposes, the Total Universe is considered to be a sphere.
    The origin point at the center of the sphere is where this known
    universe began, its big bang point. Or in game terms, where the
    last game universe ended and a new one began.

        Shaped like a thick flattened sphere, like a chubby pancake.
        A standard geometric formula for defining the shape of a
        flattened sphere can be based on the equation of an ellipsoid.
        An ellipsoid is a three-dimensional shape that can represent a
        flattened or stretched sphere. The formula for an ellipsoid is:
        frac{{x^2}}{{a^2}} + \frac{{y^2}}{{b^2}} + \frac{{z^2}}{{c^2}} = 1

        Where:
        - a represents the semi-major axis, controls extent along the x-axis.
        - b represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the y-axis.
        - c represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the z-axis.

        To create a flattened sphere shape, set a and b to equal each other
        but smaller (?) than c. This results in an ellipsoid that is flattened
        along one axis (z-axis) compared to a perfect sphere.

        Specific values of a, b, and c will determine exact shape and degree
        of flattening of the ellipsoid.  A typical value is for a, b and c
        to be 1/2 the value of x, y, and z respectively.

        To get a better sense of the shape of an ellipsoid, plot it in
        three dimensions, then use matplotlib for a rough visualization.
        For a more accurate visualization, use a 3D modeling program like
        Blender or Maya.

        The volume of an ellipsoid is given by:

        V=4/3 X Ï€ X a X b X c
         where a, b, and c are the semi-axes of the ellipsoid.

        cesium-133 vibrates exactly 9,192,631,770 times per second.
        That is a meausre of frequency which could be reproduced
        anywhere in the universe. But it is still culturally-bound in
        that the second itself is derived from the planet Earth's
        relationship to it Sun. This type of time measure is referred
        to as an atomic clock.
        To be more precise, an atomic second related to the unperturbed
        ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom.

        Meausuring the rate of pulsar pulses is also very reliable,
        and is the basis for some navigation systems. Not all pulsars
        have the same frequency, but they are all very regular.
        See: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0459-0

        Although observing and correctly measuring the frequency of the
        pulses of a pulsar is technolgically complex, it is very accurate
        and has been proposed as a superior method of timekeeping for
        autonomous spacecraft navigation.  A reference location (that is,
        a particular mature rotation-based pulsar) must be selected.
        This could be the basis for a universal time standard,
        a "galactic clock" that is used, in the game context, by the Agency.

        A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits
        beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.
        Sort of like a galatic lighthouse. The periods range from
        milliseconds to seconds.  The fastest known pulsar, PSR J1748-2446ad,
        rotates 716 times per second, so its period is 1.4 milliseconds.
        Pulsars can be more accurate, consistent than atomic clocks.

        For the game purposes, we'll define the pulsar rate as close to
        716 times per second.

        The idea for the game is to make up a pulsar llike PSR J1748-2446ad,
        assign it a very regular period, and use it as a universal time
        in reference to all other units.

        Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when a reference
        frame is moving relative to another reference frame. In the
        case of very fast travel, especially near the speed of light,
        time itself will slow down for the traveler. Also, space-time
        is curved in gravity wells like solar systems. This will need
        to be accounted for if interstellar travel and/or near-light-speed
        or (so-called) warp speed travel is allowed in the game.

        - TU = The Total Universe. The entire game universe. Most of it
        will be non-playable. For game purposes, define it as a sphere
        with a radius close to 14.25 gigaparsecs, expanding at a rate of 73.3 kilometers per second per megaparsec, in all directions.

        It is the largest astronomical  unit  defined for game play.  Size
        should be fairly constant, with only minor changes for each newly
        created object; then should fluctuates as the game universe expands during game time (only relevant for very long-lasting scenarios).

        Age of a TU at start of a game is 13.787Â±0.020 billion years, give or take.  The game software can generate multiple universes, but each
        is assumed to "occupy" the same space and time as the others and
        they do not interact with each other.

        The origin point at the center of the sphere is where this known
        universe began, its big bang point. Or in game terms, where the
        last game universe ended and a new one began. This may be used in
        a ludic context related to generations of "karma" and so on, but
        has no actual physical model.

        Dark Energy comprisees 68.3% of the universe, Dark Matter 27.4%,
        remaining 4.3% is baryonic matter (stars, planets, life, etc.),
        also referred to as "ordinary matter".

        Ordinary matter/mass = approximately 1.5Ã—10^53 kg
        For game purposes, take 4.3% as the approximate area of
        the TU sphere that contains galaxies, stars, planets, etc.

        It is exapanding in all directions at a rate of 73.3 kilometers

        The universe may be infinite. We guess at measure of the
        __observable__ universe. Being accurate is hard since no one
        really knows its shape, and it is expanding, and that expansion
        will limited by the mass of all the matter in the universe, and
        the nature of that mass is also a bit of a mystery.
        We can use these numbers, and vary them a little, just for fun!

        - GC - The Game galaxy Cluster which contains the playable galaxy.
        It is located in the XU, but is named and defined in a bit more
        detail, including have some of its galaxies identified. It's
        definition includes info about the galactic core.

        - TP = The timing pulsar. Within a GC define a pulsar that is
        used to measure time by space-traveling civilizations within that
        cluster. It is a very regular pulsar, and is used as a universal time
        standard. It is not the only pulsar in the cluster, but is the one
        that is used for timekeeping.

        - XU - External Universe: section(s) of TU that are not playable;
        no detailed galactic clusters.  Everything outside of the GC.
        Simulate some forces, movement, but not any inhabited systems.
        Situate some supernovae, black holes, galaxy cluster, etc. in
        the XU.

        Angular diameter is the apparent size of an object as
        seen from a point of view, i.e., how big a moon appears
        in the sky. Given the distance (d) and diameter (D) of
        an object, its angular diameter (Î´) can be calculated
        as follows:
        Î´ = 2 Ã— arctan(D/2d)

        In this class, we want to focus on
        - actual and apparent (from Gavor) sizes
        - mass and gravity
        - distance from Gavor
        - relative motion (speed, direction)
        Try to avoid:
        - Jumping into time units.
            - See section of defining a second in non-relative terms.
            - Think of days as rotations of planet or moon, years as orbits.
        - Making the math too complex
        - Hard-coding values too much, even in schema

        Math...

        The area of a sphere is 4 * Pi * radius squared (4 * pi * r**2).

        The distance between two points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) on a plane is:
        the square root of (x2 - x1) squared plus (y2 - y1) squared,
        that is:  sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

        The distance between two points in xyz-space is square root of
        sum of the squares of the differences between coordinates.
        That is,
            given P1 = (x1,y1,z1) and P2 = (x2,y2,z2),
            the distance between P1 and P2 is given by
            d(P1,P2) = sqrt ((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2).

        This measures will come into play when we start to define bodies
        in space and the graviational effect they have on each other.

        A common measure of mass is the solar mass, which is the mass of
        our Sun, Sol. In the game world, of Fatun. In either case, it
        is unit. The mass of the Sun is 1.9891 x 10^30 kg. But one solar
        mass is 1.0.

        Define one or more python methods, organized in a class module,
        to generate a model TU for game play  purposes. It should indicate
        size, mass, rate of expansion, etc., using center of sphere as
        (rough) reference point to identify TU, XU, and GC boundaries and
        characteristics, including the total baryonic mass available to work
        with in the GC and location of the TP within the GC.

        Parameters:  allow for either accepting  a random diameter within
        pre-defined constraints, or for a simple input indicating to
        generate the model of a slightly larger or slightly smaller
        universe, in relationship to the predefined constraints.

        Return the model as an instantiated class object. Include methods
        to save the model to a file, such as a pickled file, and to load it
        from a file.

        - GG - The Game Galaxy: section of TU that is playable.
        It is one galaxy within the GC. There can be multiple GG's
        within a GC.

        - SSG - Simulated Star Systems Group is a section of the GG where
        multiple star systems are simulated, including their planets and
        the planets' satellites. It begins with describing the star only.
        Fill in other details only as needed. The SSG is a defined playable
        area of the GG.

        There can be multiple SSG's within a GG.

        - SSS - Simulated Star System. A section of the SSG where a star
        and its planets are simulated. It begins with describing the star
        only. Fill in other details only as needed. The SSS is a defined
        playable area of the SG. There can be multiple SSS's within a SG.

        The SSS needs to be about 1/3 of the way towards the galactic core
        from the rim of the GG. Any closer and destruction by supernovae
        is likely.  Star systems expected to have life-bearing planets
        should include at least two gas giants, not just one, so that
        they can tug on each other and prevent the rocky planets from
        being sucked into the sun along with the gas giant.

        Other scenarios are possible, but this is the most common one.

        An SSS sun should be relatively small but large enough to warm
        the inner planets.  The sun should be a yellow dwarf, not a
        red dwarf, so that it can support life.



        SPS - Simulated Planetary System. A section of the SSS where
        a planet and its satellites are simulated. It begins with the
        planet. Fill in other details only as needed. The SPS is a
        defined playable area of the SSS. There can -- and really should
        be multiple SPS's within a SSS.

        If the SPS is intended to support organic life, it should be
        relatively close to the star, but not too close, or be a moon
        of a gas giant and have its own atmosphere.

        Based on inputs and rules, return dimensions, mass, rate of
        expansion, etc. for each section of such a play Universe.

        cesium-133 vibrates exactly 9,192,631,770 times per second.
        That is a meausrement of frequency which could be reproduced
        anywhere in the universe. But it is still culturally-bound in
        that the second itself is derived from the planet Earth's
        relationship to it Sun. This type of time measure is referred
        to as an atomic clock.
        To be more precise, an atomic second related to the unperturbed
        ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom.


        Meausuring the rate of pulsar pulses is also very reliable,
        and is the basis for some navigation systems. Not all pulsars
        have the same frequency, but they are all very regular.
        See: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0459-0

        Although observing and correctly measuring the frequency of the
        pulses of a pulsar is technolgically complex, it is very accurate
        and has been proposed as a superior method of timekeeping for
        autonomous spacecraft navigation.  A reference location (that is,
        a particular mature rotation-based pulsar) must be selected.
        This could be the basis for a universal time standard,
        a "celestial clock" that is used by the Agency.

        A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits
        beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.
        Sort of like a galatic lighthouse. The periods range from
        milliseconds to seconds.  The fastest known pulsar, PSR J1748-2446ad,
        rotates 716 times per second, so its period is 1.4 milliseconds.
        Pulsars can be more accurate, consistent than atomic clocks.

        The idea for the game is to make up a pulsar llike PSR J1748-2446ad,
        assign it a very regular period, and use it as a universal time
        in reference to all other units.


        Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when a reference
        frame is moving relative to another reference frame. In the
        case of very fast travel, especially near the speed of light,
        time itself will slow down for the traveler. Also, space-time
        is curved in gravity wells like solar systems. This will need
        to be accounted for if interstellar travel and/or near-light-speed
        or (so-called) warp speed travel is allowed in the game.
