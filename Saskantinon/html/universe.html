<h1>To Do / Current Design Questions</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Store location and size (centerpoint relative to center of Univ,
      volume) of the Galactic Cluster on the database.
    <li>It must have a foreign key associating the GC with a UNIV.
    <li>Use that persisted data when computing the location of a new GC
      to make sure that it does not overlap with any existing GC.
    <li>Ask ChatGPT to help with collision algoriths for spheres
      and ellipsoids in a 3D space. It may be necessary to imagine
      both universe and cluster(s) as contained in rects? Not sure.
      Could make some math easier anyway!
    <li>Figuring this out will mean we can use similar logic when handling
      galaxies within the cluster, star systems within the galaxy and so on.
</ul>


<h1>Data Management</h1>

<h2>Data Persistence</h2>
    All values are stored as a 2-tuple where [0] = value and [1] = type
    of measurement unit, as defined by the SaskanMath() class.

    The type of object, i.e., what is being measured, is also identified
    via reference to a value defined in SaskanMath()'s "M" dataclass.

    Data stored in pickled format as a BLOB on sqlite3 database.

<h1>UniverseModel</h1>

<h2>Mass and Matter</h2>
    For the purposes of the game, we consider mass and matter to
    be the same thing. Antimatter equals matter at the big bang, but
    then almost entirely vanishes. No one knows why. Theoretically,
    the universe should not exist since matter and antimatter should
    have annihilated each other. But it does. So, we will assume that
    the universe is made of matter, not antimatter, and that the
    antimatter "went somewhere".

<h2>Shape of Universe</h2>
    For game purposes, the Total Universe is considered to be a sphere.
    The origin point at the center of the sphere is where this known
    universe began, its big bang point. Or in game terms, where the
    last game universe ended and a new one began.

<h2>Size of Universe</h2>
    Volume of known universe: 3.566 x 10^80 cubic meters
    Another estimate is 415,065 Glyr3  (cubic gigalight years).
    For game purposes, the size of the universe will randomly fluctuate
    around this value.

<h1>Galactic Cluster Model</h1>


<h2>Location of Cluster</h2>
        Generate a random location vector (x, y, z) in megaparsecs
        locating the GC center as a random point within the TU
        in relation to the TU center (center of the universe)
        Ensure that x, y, and z are at least 2/3 of the TU radius.

<h2>Shape of Cluster</h2>
        Shaped like a thick flattened sphere, like a chubby pancake.
        A standard geometric formula for defining the shape of a
        flattened sphere can be based on the equation of an ellipsoid.
        An ellipsoid is a three-dimensional shape that can represent a
        flattened or stretched sphere. The formula for an ellipsoid is:
        frac{{x^2}}{{a^2}} + \frac{{y^2}}{{b^2}} + \frac{{z^2}}{{c^2}} = 1

        Where:
        - a represents the semi-major axis, controls extent along the x-axis.
        - b represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the y-axis.
        - c represents the semi-minor axis, controls extent along the z-axis.

        To create a flattened sphere shape, set a and b to equal each other
        but smaller (?) than c. This results in an ellipsoid that is flattened
        along one axis (z-axis) compared to a perfect sphere.

        Specific values of a, b, and c will determine exact shape and degree
        of flattening of the ellipsoid.  A typical value is for a, b and c
        to be 1/2 the value of x, y, and z respectively.

<h2>Volume of Cluster</h2>
        The volume of an ellipsoid is given by:
        V=4/3 X Ï€ X a X b X c
         where a, b, and c are the semi-axes of the ellipsoid.

<h2>Visualization of Cluster</h2>
        Eventually, maybe use Blender. Get a better sense of the shape of
        the ellipsoid by plotting and visualizing it in three dimensions. I am
        not yet 100% sure that I am defining the ellipsoid shapes correctly.

        Break each calculation into a method. If it seems they could have an
        abstract use, try to parameterize appropriately. For very common
        formulas (distance, volume, etc) move them into saskan_math.

<h1>Timing Pulsar</h1>

<h2>Location of Pulsar</h2>
        Compute a location within the GC that is
        a random distance from the GC center but
        relatively close (inner 1/3rd of the ellipsoid)
        to the core/center of the galactic cluster.
        Cluster shape is ellipsoid, not a sphere; so
        calculuation is more complex than just using
        one radius value.

<h2>Atomic Clock</h2>
        cesium-133 vibrates exactly 9,192,631,770 times per second.
        That is a meausre of frequency which could be reproduced
        anywhere in the universe. But it is still culturally-bound in
        that the second itself is derived from the planet Earth's
        relationship to it Sun. This type of time measure is referred
        to as an atomic clock.
        To be more precise, an atomic second related to the unperturbed
        ground state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom.

<h2>Pulsar Clock</h2>
        Meausuring the rate of pulsar pulses is also very reliable,
        and is the basis for some navigation systems. Not all pulsars
        have the same frequency, but they are all very regular.
        See: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11214-017-0459-0

        Although observing and correctly measuring the frequency of the
        pulses of a pulsar is technolgically complex, it is very accurate
        and has been proposed as a superior method of timekeeping for
        autonomous spacecraft navigation.  A reference location (that is,
        a particular mature rotation-based pulsar) must be selected.
        This could be the basis for a universal time standard,
        a "galactic clock" that is used, in the game context, by the Agency.

<h2>Galactic Lighthouse</h2>
        A pulsar is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits
        beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.
        Sort of like a galatic lighthouse. The periods range from
        milliseconds to seconds.  The fastest known pulsar, PSR J1748-2446ad,
        rotates 716 times per second, so its period is 1.4 milliseconds.
        Pulsars can be more accurate, consistent than atomic clocks.

        For the game purposes, we'll define the pulsar rate as close to
        716 times per second.

        The idea for the game is to make up a pulsar llike PSR J1748-2446ad,
        assign it a very regular period, and use it as a universal time
        in reference to all other units.

<h2>Time Dilation</h2>
        Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs when a reference
        frame is moving relative to another reference frame. In the
        case of very fast travel, especially near the speed of light,
        time itself will slow down for the traveler. Also, space-time
        is curved in gravity wells like solar systems. This will need
        to be accounted for if interstellar travel and/or near-light-speed
        or (so-called) warp speed travel is allowed in the game.
