<h2>Mass and Matter</h2>
    For the purposes of the game, we consider mass and matter to
    be the same thing. Antimatter equals matter at the big bang, but
    then almost entirely vanishes. No one know why. Theoretically,
    the universe should not exist since matter and antimatter should
    have annihilated each other. But it does. So, we will assume that
    the universe is made of matter, not antimatter, and that the
    antimatter "went somewhere".

<h2>Shape of Universe</h2>
    For game purposes, the Total Universe is considered to be a sphere.
    The origin point at the center of the sphere is where this known
    universe began, its big bang point. Or in game terms, where the
    last game universe ended and a new one began.

<h2>Size of Universe</h2>
    Volume of known universe: 3.566 x 10^80 cubic meters
    Another estimate is 415,065 Glyr3  (cubic gigalight years).
    For game purposes, the size of the universe will randomly fluctuate
    around this value.
