<h1>StarSystemModel</h1>

<h2>Star Systems Group</h2>
        - SSG - Simulated Star Systems Group is a section of the GG where
        multiple star systems are simulated, including their planets and
        the planets' satellites. It begins with describing their star only.
        Fill in other details only as needed. The SSG is a defined playable
        area of the GG.

        There can be multiple SSG's within a GG. They should not overlap.

<h2>Star System</h2>
        - SSS - Simulated Star System. A section of the SSG where a star
        and its planets are simulated. It begins with describing the star
        only. Fill in other details only as needed. The SSS is a defined
        playable area of the SG. There can be multiple SSS's within a SG.

        The SSS needs to be about 1/3 of the way towards the galactic core
        from the rim of the GG. Any closer and destruction by supernovae
        is likely.  Star systems expected to have life-bearing planets
        should include at least two gas giants, not just one, so that
        they can tug on each other and prevent the rocky planets from
        being sucked into the sun along with the gas giant.

        Other scenarios are possible, but this is the most common one.

        An SSS sun should be relatively small but large enough to warm
        the inner planets.  The sun should be a yellow dwarf, not a
        red dwarf, so that it can support life.

        Star Systems must not overlap unless we want big trouble! :-)

<h2>Planetary System</h2>
        SPS - Simulated Planetary System. A section of the SSS where
        a planet and its satellites are simulated. It begins with the
        planet. Fill in other details only as needed. The SPS is a
        defined playable area of the SSS. There can -- and really should
        be multiple SPS's within a SSS.

        If the SPS is intended to support organic life, it should be
        relatively close to the star, but not too close, or be a moon
        of a gas giant and have its own atmosphere.

        May want another level of modeling for Satellites, Globules (of various
        types), and space stations and space ships.
