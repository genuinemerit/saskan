<h1>GalaxyModel</h1>

<h2>Galactic Groups and Clusters</h2>
        Strictly speaking there are both galactic groups and galactic
        clusters. The latter have thousands of galaxies; the former
        have hundreds of galaxies. For game purposes, we will refer
        to both as "clusters". May want to revisit the GC generator
        to distinguish them, but for now, let's just assume that our
        game GC is a cluster, that it can hold thousands of galaxies.

<h2>Relationships</h2>
        There can be one to many GG's within the Galactic Cluster.
        GG's should not overlap with one another, so it is
        necessary to have access to any existing Game Galaxies when
        generating a new one.

<h2>Size and content of Galaxies</h2>
        - Large - trillions of stars, millions of light-years diameter.
        - Medium - billions or millions of stars. 100,000-ish light-years diameter
        - Small - a few thousand stars, a few hundred light-years diameter.
        - Almost always a supermassive black hole at the center, on the
          order of 4.1 million solar (Sol) masses.

<h2>Shape of Galaxies</h2>
        - Most are spiral or elliptical in shape, but this is located within
          a "halo" defined by the gravity well of the galactic core.
        - Some have an irregular shape.
        - Many have a galactic bulge at the center. More common in larger
          clusters. The bulge is thought to have formed by the merger of
          nearby galaxies.
        - An elliptical bulge of densely-packed stars & globules surrounds the
          nucleus (super-massive black hole or SMBH). Maybe 10% of radius.
          The bulge is thicker than the surrounding "disk". A smaller, newer,
          more isolated galaxy may have a SMBH without a bulge.

<h2>Spiral Galaxies</h2>
        - Spiral arms of stars emerge from the bulge.  Two very large, emitted
          from the ends of the central bulge; two very sparse, also emitted
          from the ends, trailing "behind" the large spirals. The minor spiral
          may or may not join up with "its" major spiral.
        - The thickness of the arms diminishes the further from the bulge.
        - Seen from the side, the galaxy looks like a classic "UFO" shape.
        - Distribution of stars in the sprials varies and there are outliers.
        - Earth-Moon system in about 2/3rds of the way from the core, in a
          minor arm which later rejoins a major arm.
        - Some globular clusters are located far from the "disk" but within
          the "halo" (sphere / gravity well) of the core.

<h2>Disk-shaped Galaxies</h2>
        Disk shape:
        - Stars are arranged move evenly in a flattish "disk" emanating from
          the core.

<h2>Movement of Galaxies</h2>
        - Galaxies generally rotate around their core.
        - The Earth's solar system rotates around the Milky Way core
          once every 240 million Earth years.
        - This kind of movement is interesting, but probably not
          relevant to the game until (maybe) I add space travel.
        - The Milky Way is medium sized sprial. About 100,000 light-years
          across, and 1,000 light years thick. Roughly a roundish ellipsoid.
          It is thought to have 100 to 400 billion stars. Let's just pretend
          the number is 300 billion.
        - The entire galaxy moves at about 600 km/second with respect to
          an "extragalactic frame of reference". For game purposes, we can
          define some kind of galactic movement around the center of the GC,
          and then define a movement of the GC around the center of the TU.

<h2>Measurement of Galaxies</h2>
        - We divide the Milky Way into quadrants releative to the location of
          our Sun.
        - For game purposes, it will probably make more sense to use galactic
          core as the center/reference point.

<h2>Simulation of Galaxies</h2>
        - The first step might be to define a distribution pattern of baryonic
          matter. Not concerned with dark energy and dark matter for now.
        - Galactic bulge: may be disk-like, elliptoid, spherical, non-existent.
        - There is much more... stars are born and die. I am not entirely sure
          how relevant any that will be for game purposes, since the timelines
          are so vastly out of line. The game covers about 5,000 Gavoran years,
          and so far is entirely from the POV of one planet, though that could
          expand. But even then, I am thinking maybe 50,000 years and keeping
          to solar systems relatively close to the main planet. We'll see.
        - Suggest we just make up some proportions, for example:
            - SMBH is about 4.1 million solar masses.
            - Bulge is roughly the same.
            - So that is 8.2 million out of ~300 billion.
            - Make a proportion of 2.7333e-05 mass in core vs. the arms.
            - Just compute a number of start in the galaxy, then divide up
              the baryonic mass available. For each star, goof around with
              that number, seeing if I can't come up with something reasonably
              fun  for a G-type yellow star system, etc. (then keep breaking
              it down for planets, satellites, asteroids, globular clusters,
              etc.) It doesn't really matter than much, does it?
            - I suppose some kind of algorithm that says, OK, if I have x
              amount of matter available, then I should allocate n star systems.
