<h3><a name="svc_design">Services Design</a></h3>

<p>The design intention is to make the system flexible and anti-fragile. By defining all services as metadata, it is hoped that modifications can occur largely by observing and testing behaviors which can be added, tweaked, removed, refactored largely "on the fly", or at least without a great deal of re-compling/re-deploying program code.

<p>By using an ontology as the foundation, it is further intended that the design of both the services architecture and game content can be developed and changed in a manner that is flexible, controlled and obvious. To this end, the idea is that SQL code should be auto-generated as much as possible based on interpretation of behavioral use case patterns.
