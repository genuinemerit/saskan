        <p>The Controller component directs the traffic on a given Channel. This component is often referred to as a Server.
        <p>It is implemented as a python class with a module name like "[servicens]_server.py".
        <p>The controller has two asyncio tasks:
            <ul>
                <li>The "server" task, which handles a stream reader and a stream writer. On a specified host and port, it waits for and gathers messages for a given channel, which is subscribed to by a set of peers. When a message is received, then it is passed along to the channel's subscribers.
                <li>The "main" task, which launches the server.
            </ul>
