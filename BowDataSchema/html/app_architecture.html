<h3><a name="architecture">Application Architecture</a></h3>

<p>Saskan Eyes is an event-driven, message-based application for controlling, monitoring and editing services and content for the game "Saskantinon, The Land Between Two Rivers". 
    
<p>It uses PyQt5 (pyside2) as a GUI engine, with diagrams generated by networkx and matplotlib, then displayed as PNG images.

<p>The backend database supporting service definition, execution and monitoring is Redis.

<p>An application ontology provides basis for auto-generating a relational database schema.

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>Nearly all programming is done in Python3.9 using the VS Code editor.

<p>Some low-level development and testing of Redis structures may use redis-cli and, if needed, the GDB debugger attached to redis-server. See:  https://redis.io/commands and https://redis.io/topics/debugging

<p>The app ontology is managed as an OWL structure edited using the Protege editor.  Relational database is implemented at present using SQLite, but likely to be moved eventually to Postgres.

<p>Code is versioned on GitHub. The main repositories used at present are:
    <ul>
        <li>https://github.com/genuinemerit/bow-data-schema</li>
        <li>https://github.com/genuinemerit/bow-quiver</li>
    </ul>

<p>So far, all testing and development is taking place on Ubuntu Linux.
