<p>The Monitor GUI reads the Monitor and Log databases to display information at both summary and detailed levels regarding the state and the status of the server, responder and requestor components of the system.
    
<p>As the system becomes more hardened, the intention is that the Monitor will be able to provide data to the user/admin and/or to a "smart" (AI/ML) automated observer, which can make adjustments to the system based on the data.  For example, spinning up additional instances of a given type of server to relieve load pressure, avoid bottlenecks, or to prepare for and then throttle back down from known/expected peak load times.
    
<p>Such feedback may also help with application design, as it could indicate what features (services) are most commonly or least commonly requested.
